<p style="color:green;">Explosions in space.</p>

<marquee> The main explosions in space are called supernovas and happen when a star dies.
A star dies when a star has too much iron in it's core, and collapses in on itself.
This creates a huge explosion which creates a nebula, at the center of this nebula is a neutron star,
which consists of tigntly packed protons and is usually a few miles long. </marquee>

<marquee>There is also a smaller cousin to the supernova the nova.This explosion happens when a netroun star and a large red giant star are orbiting around each other. The more dense neutron star takes matter from the red giant until the neutron star cannot hold onto the additional matter any longer and sheds it in a explosion which is smaller than a supernova but still quite large.

<marquee>Black holes form when the prosess which normally creates a nertron star happens to a blue giant star, the coreof the star collapses due to it's own weight and becomes a black hole. Black holes have the most gravitational pull out of any object in the known universe and this is due to all of the matter in a black hole being conpressed into a infinitely small point called a singularity. Black holes do not alow light to escape giving them their name. The event horison of a black hole is the point at which nothing can escape.   </marquee>

<marquee> There are 3 Main Star Types. The first type is a Blue giant, these stars are massive and emit the most light out of all the star types, these stars do not have as large of a lifespan as other types of stars because
  they emit so much energy. The second type of star is a regular mass star. These stars are like our sun and have a yellow shade of light. Finnaly thre are the red dwarfs. These stars emit a cool red glow and are the smallest stars. These stars can last for trillions of years because of how little light they emit.</marquee>

<marquee> There are many types of planets in or solar system but they usually fall into two main types. The first type is gas giant, these planets have huge atmospheres and are mostly made of gas with a small metal core at the center. An example of this type of planet is saturn. Then there are the rocky planets which are made out of mostly rock with small atmoshperes. An example of this type of planet is Earth.</marquee>
